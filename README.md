# Eye Movements Lesion Simulator

__Objective:__ Create a web-based simulator of eye movement deficits secondary to lesions in the oculomotor pathway.
In addition the user can toggle light on and off to test the pupillary response with each lesion localization, and in lesions that result
in ptosis (droopy eyelid) they can also lift the eyelid.
