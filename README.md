# Eye Movements Lesion Simulator

The objective of the project is to create a web-based simulator of eye movement deficits secondary to lesions in the oculomotor pathway.
In addition the user can toggle light on and off to test the pupillary response with each lesion localization, and in lesions that result
in ptosis (droopy eyelid) they can also lift the eyelid.

<i>Note:</i> There is an animation for right eye nystagmus on rightward gaze when there is a lesion of the left medial longitudinal
fasciculus (internuclear ophtalmoplegia). For some reason the animation doesn't work on Chrome until the user clicks on the "move right"
button twice.
